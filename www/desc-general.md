**An Overview of Water Stress Index**

This index, for any location, is expressed as the ratio of accumulative precipitation to potential evapotranspiration during a given time period. 

### $$\frac{accprecip_{end_date} - accprecip_{start_date}} {accpet_{end_date} - accpet_{start_date}}$$

- $accprecip_{end_date}$ is accumulative precipitation from start date to the end date
- $accprecip_{start_date}$ is accumulative precipitation from start date to the end date
- $accpet_{end_date}$ is accumulative potential evaporation from start date to the end date
- $accpet_{start_date}$ is accumulative potential evaporation from start date to the end date


When the index is larger than 1, the climate condition for the location can be defined as humid. When the index is 0.5 - 1, then this location is semi-arid. If the index is below 0.5, then it is arid.
